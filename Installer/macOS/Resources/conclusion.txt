OpenSim is now installed in either:

  - /Applications/ (if you installed system-wide), or
  - ~/Applications/ (if you selected "Install for me only").

If you have installed OpenSim previously, you can run the following in a
Terminal to clear previous OpenSim preferences:

    defaults delete org.opensim.utils
