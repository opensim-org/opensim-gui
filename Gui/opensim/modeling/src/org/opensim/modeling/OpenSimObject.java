/**
 *  This is the base class for all %OpenSim objects that are serializable <br>
 * (meaning they can be written to and read back from files). In particular, all <br>
 * ModelComponent objects derive from %Object. It provides a common base class <br>
 * from which to derive serializable objects and also some basic functionality, <br>
 * such as writing to files in XML format, managing properties, and the equality, <br>
 * less than, and output operators.<br>
 * <br>
 * An %Object maintains a table of "properties" that know how to read themselves <br>
 * from XML and write themselves to XML. The available Property types are<br>
 *   -# Primitive data types (int, bool, double, std::string, ...) <br>
 *   -# Properties that contain other Objects, <br>
 *   -# Properties containing lists of either of the previous 2 categories<br>
 * <br>
 * It is important to note that Objects and Properties together form a recursive<br>
 * tree structure that is the representation of an %OpenSim Model. See the<br>
 * documentation for the OpenSim::Property class for more information.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h3>%Object declaration</h3><br>
 * <br>
 * The declaration of every class derived from %Object <i>must</i> have its first line<br>
 * (that is, immediately after the "{" in the class declaration) one of four<br>
 * standard "boilerplate" macros:<br>
 * {@code 
  OpenSim_DECLARE_CONCRETE_OBJECT  (ClassName, SuperclassName);
  OpenSim_DECLARE_CONCRETE_OBJECT_T(ClassName, T, SuperclassName);
  OpenSim_DECLARE_ABSTRACT_OBJECT  (ClassName, SuperclassName);
  OpenSim_DECLARE_ABSTRACT_OBJECT_T(ClassName, T, SuperclassName);
}<br>
 * ("Superclass" means the immediate class from which the class derives; that<br>
 * terminology is borrowed from Java. It is often called the "Parent" class but <br>
 * we'll use "Super" which is more precise.) The "_T" variants of the above macros <br>
 * are used for objects that are templatized, like Set&lt;T&gt;. <br>
 * <br>
 * These macros provide a standardized set of declarations for every object, <br>
 * including<br>
 * {@code 
    typedef ClassName      Self;                // for all classes
    typedef SuperclassName Super;               // for all classes
    static const std::string& getClassName();   // for all classes
    const std::string& getConcreteClassName();  // for concrete classes only
    ClassName* clone() const;                   // see below
}<br>
 * getClassName() is a static method that returns the name of the %Object-derived <br>
 * class for which it is invoked. For example, ModelComponent::getClassName() <br>
 * returns "ModelComponent". In contrast, getConcreteClassName() is a pure virtual <br>
 * method of %Object that returns the class name of the actual concrete object <br>
 * being referenced through the abstract base class. This method is implemented <br>
 * only in concrete classes.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that getClassName() and getConcreteClassName() will return the same string<br>
 * only if the referenced class is concrete. For example,<br>
 * {@code 
    Function* funcp = new LinearFunction(...);
    std::cout << funcp->getClassName();          // output: "Function"
    std::cout << funcp->getConcreteClassName();  // output: "LinearFunction"
}<br>
 * <br>
 * For concrete objects, the class name is used as the "object type tag", the tag <br>
 * string that will appear in XML files. Also, when a Property&lt;T&gt; has no name<br>
 * (allowed for properties that contain just a single object) the object class <br>
 * name T (which may be abstract like Function or ModelComponent) is used to <br>
 * select the property. See OpenSim::Property for more information.<br>
 * <br>
 * The standard clone() method produces a duplicate of a concrete object and thus<br>
 * is implemented only for concrete classes. However, the return type must<br>
 * always match the type of the invoking object (this is called a "covariant type"<br>
 * and does not change the method's identity). It is therefore redeclared even in<br>
 * abstract classes, but remains pure virtual in those cases. That means if you<br>
 * invoke Function::clone() you'll get back a Function* rather than an Object*;<br>
 * this avoids many unnecessary invocations of the awkward and expensive<br>
 * dynamic_cast operator.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h3>%Object registration and renaming</h3><br>
 * <br>
 * An %Object type needs to be "registered" by calling Object::registerType() with<br>
 * an instance of a concrete object so that the serialization infrastructure knows <br>
 * what kind of %Object to create when it encounters a specific XML tag. This <br>
 * associates the concrete object's class name (object type tag) with a default <br>
 * instance of that object. The registration process is normally done during <br>
 * dynamic library (DLL) loading, that is, as part of the static initializer<br>
 * execution that occurs before program execution.<br>
 * <br>
 * For backwards compatibility, we support a renaming mechanism in which <br>
 * now-deprecated class names can be mapped to their current equivalents. This<br>
 * is done via a string-to-string table mapping the old names to the new ones;<br>
 * only the current names appear in the registered objects table. Specification of<br>
 * these aliases is done immediately after registration in the DLL static <br>
 * initializer.<br>
 * <br>
 * <h3>Defaults mechanism</h3><br>
 * <br>
 * When an %Object is registered (either programmatically, or<br>
 * overridden in the defaults section of a document), a copy of it is maintained <br>
 * in a dictionary as a "default" object of its class. When new instances of this <br>
 * class are requested, the contents of the default object are used to populate the<br>
 * new instance before deserialization. This allows for specifying default values<br>
 * that will be commonly used in one place in the XML file rather than with each <br>
 * object which leads to smaller files that are easier to read. Property values<br>
 * that obtain their values from the defaults and are not subsequently overridden<br>
 * are marked as being default values, allowing us to avoid writing<br>
 * them back out when serializing.<br>
 * <br>
