/**
 *  This class provides a description of a mesh made of polygonal faces (not <br>
 * limited to triangles). Its primary purpose is for loading geometry from files, <br>
 * which can then be used for visualization or collision detection. For example, <br>
 * the following lines load a mesh from a Wavefront OBJ file, then create a <br>
 * DecorativeMesh from it.<br>
 * {@code 
    PolygonalMesh mesh;
    mesh.loadObjFile("teapot.obj");
    DecorativeMesh decoration(mesh);
} <br>
 * You can also read a polygon mesh from a VTK PolyData (.vtp) file, or an STL<br>
 * file (.stl) that is in ascii or binary format. You can also build meshes <br>
 * programmatically, and some static methods are provided here for generating some<br>
 * common shapes. If you don't know what kind of file you have, you can attempt to <br>
 * read it with the loadFile() method which will examine the file extension to <br>
 * determine the expected format.<br>
 * <br>
 * The mesh has its own local frame and vertex locations are given in that <br>
 * frame. You can scale and transform the vertices relative to that frame <br>
 * (changing the values stored in the mesh) but more commonly the mesh will be<br>
 * placed on a body relative to that body's frame, meaning you can re-use the<br>
 * same mesh in various places.<br>
 * <br>
 * We expect this to be a large object so give it shared (reference) semantics; <br>
 * that is, the copy constructor and copy assignment default to shallow copies <br>
 * (both handles will refer to the same data). If you want to make a deep <br>
 * (non-shared) copy of a PolygonalMesh, use the copyAssign() method provided by <br>
 * the PIMPLHandle base class. *
