- Fix issue [#523](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/523): Keep visualizer alive through arbitrary long idle time.

v4.4
====
- Upgrade visualizer codebase to later threejs version 126.
- Upgrade jxBrowser to version 6.24 which was required to make visualizer code work/show.
- Fix issue [#1319](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/1319): Undo/redo support for show-COM, show-Axes
- Animate transition of camera to standard views.
- Fix issue [#1298] look & feel on linux 
- Fix visualization of muscle paths in the presense of ConditionalPathPoints, multiple wrap objects or mixes of them. Fix issues [#1330][#1331].
- Fix crash deleting external-force in ExternalLoads editing dialog [#1280]
- Propagate frame changes to all components in the model either owned or connected by sockets to the frame, fix issue [#1340]


v4.3
====
- Upgrade application to be based on the latest NetBeans platorm included with Apache NetBeans 12.3, from disconinued netbeans 8.2. The upgrade supports high DPI monitors.
- IMUs on a model are now shown under the Other Components node in the navigator where they can be selected, shown/hidden. 
- Tools that use Analyses (e.g. Analyze, ...) now have a new option for IMUDataReporter where Output signals are reported for IMUs on the model, or can be reported for user specified Frames.
- Upgrade bindings to use SWIG 4.0.2 and carry doxygen to java and python files as comments.
- Support display of Other components in the naviagtor view, including IMUs.
- Implement setting of "report orientation errors" checkbox from IMUInverseKinematicsTool GUI

v4.2
====
- Merge PR [#1181](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/pull/1181): Add build support for Linux (beta)
- Fix issue [#1182](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/1182): Scaling model with custom geometry meshes loses custom geomerty
- Support new logging system utilizing spdlog introduced in opensim-core.
- Removed reference to kinematics of external loads from External Loads creation/editing dialog
- Added option to visualize sensor data (quaternions) in the application (File ->Load Sensor Data)
- Associate motion data now handles orientation sensors as well so that orientation triads follow motions
- When recording videos, if the user starts playing back a motion, recording is restarted to first animation frame.
- Allow users to change video format from scripting shell (support gif, jpg, png with setVisualizerOption("video_format", "png")). 
- Add Tools for Calibrating model based on IMU data and to solve Inverse Kinematics problem from IMU data.
- Fix issue where transforming trc marker data in the application always produces a file with "m" as units in header.

v4.1

- Fix issue [#1123](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/1123): GUI displays disabled muscles in red-blue range during/after StaticOptimization.
- Fix issue [#1127](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/1127): Change default time in the toolbar forward simulation tool to 5 seconds. 
- Fix issue [#1107](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui/issues/1107): Shading of model markers is not consistent with experimental markers
